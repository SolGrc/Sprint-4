                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mighty Ducks Hockey League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL is run by a small full-time staff and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.</p>
